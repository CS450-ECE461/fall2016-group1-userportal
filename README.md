5. Open new terminal window and run backend's repo.
6. Run User's repo on a new terminal window.
7. Check the mongo terminal to see if the connections have been made.
8. Go to [localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001) to render the users views.

###Create a new branch, do not commit directly to **origin master**, to do so:
1. `git branch [name]` give it a proper name
2. `git checkout [name]`
