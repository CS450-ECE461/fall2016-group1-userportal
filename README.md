##How to use:
1. Clone the project
2. On Command Line type: `npm install` this will install the dependencies needed for the project.
3. To run type: `npm start` this will start lite-server

##Steps to using Angular for Windows:
1. Install [Node.js installer v.7.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Play around with the [Quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) to familiarize yourself with Angular. 

#Create a new branch, do not commit directly to **origin master**, to do so:
1. `git branch [name]` give it a proper name
2. `git checkout [name]`
